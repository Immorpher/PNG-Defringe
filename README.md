# PNG-Defringe

Using PNG Defringe can remove colored fringes from resampled and filtered graphics which have transparency. This is achieved in transparent pixels of true-color PNG graphics based on weighted average of the nearest opaque pixels or a user-defined color. The level of shading (number of pixels) around an opaque pixel can be defined while leaving the user-defined color elsewhere in the transparent pixel space. This program is designed only for true-color PNG formatted images.
